        desc: "The mission behind Hercegovačka izba and the creation of Medallion.ba was to make a meaningful mark online by bringing attention to a traditional Herzegovinian delicacy known as Ćupter, a sweet that had faded from public memory over hundered of years. Once a cherished part of the region's culinary heritage, Ćupter had become a forgotten treasure, known only to the older generations and rarely seen in modern kitchens or markets. Through this website, the goal was to tell the story of Ćupter—where it comes from, how it's made, and why it deserves a place in today's world. The idea was not only to preserve tradition, but to revive it. By introducing Ćupter to a broader audience—both in Herzegovina and beyond. Hercegovačka izba hopes to inspire a renewed appreciation for authentic, handmade sweets rooted in culture and history. In addition to storytelling and cultural presentation, the client wanted the site to be functional and accessible. A very simple and user-friendly webshop was included, allowing visitors who are curious about Ćupter, or who fondly remember it, to easily purchase it online and experience this unique taste of Herzegovina for themselves.",
